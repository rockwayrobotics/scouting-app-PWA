# Scouting App PWA
Just run a webserver in the root and it should work.

This app is using the [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org) framework as it looked like a good simple one.

## To-Do:
- [x] Separate Pit & Match scout data
- [x] Store data in IndexedDB
- [x] Load data from IndexedDB
- [x] More descriptive input labels
- [ ] Input positions
- [ ] Auto track cycle/pickup time
- [ ] Load data from Backend into IndexedDB
- [ ] Select from events
- [ ] Driver Meeting view
	- Avg. scoring time
	- Preferred pickup style
	- Fastest pickup style
### Issues:
- [x] Match list only loads on save
- [x] Can't set linked team for match
- [x] Inputed values aren't cleared on load
- [x] Load buttons must be pressed twice to reset placeholders
- [x] Lists aren't loaded on page load
